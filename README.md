# Firebase Admin Python SDK

The Firebase Admin Python SDK enables server-side (backend) Python developers
to integrate [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) into their services
and applications. Currently this SDK provides Firebase custom authentication
support.


## Unit Testing
We use [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) for writing and executing
unit tests. Download pytest 3.0.6 or higher using pip:

```
pip install -U pytest
```

All source files containing test code is located in the `tests/`
directory. Simply launch pytest from the root of the Git repository, or from
within the `tests/` directory to execute all test cases.

```
pytest
```

Refer to the pytest [usage and invocations guide](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html)
to learn how to run a subset of all test cases.


## Running Linters
We use [pylint](https://pylint.org/) for verifying source code format, and
enforcing other Python programming best practices. Install pylint 1.6.4 or
higher using pip:

```
pip install -U pylint
```

Specify a pylint version explicitly if the above command installs an older
version:

```
pip install pylint==1.6.4
```

Once installed, you can check the version of the installed binary by running
the following command:

```
pylint --version
```

There is a pylint configuration file (`.pylintrc`) at the root of this Git
repository. This enables you to invoke pylint directly from the command line:

```
pylint firebase
```

However, it is recommended that you use the `lint.sh` bash script to invoke
pylint. This script will run the linter on both `firebase` and the corresponding
`tests` module. It suprresses some of the noisy warnings that get generated
when running pylint on test code. Note that by default `lint.sh` will only
validate the locally modified source files. To validate all source files,
pass `all` as an argument.

```
./lint.sh      # Lint locally modified source files
./lint.sh all  # Lint all source files 
```

Ideally you should not see any pylint errors or warnings when you run the
linter. This means source files are properly formatted, and the linter has
not found any issues. If you do observe any errors, fix them before
committing or sending a pull request. Details on how to interpret pylint
errors are available
[here](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/output.html).

Our configuration files suppress the verbose reports usually generated
by pylint, and only output the detected issues. If you wish to obtain the
comprehensive reports, run pylint from command-line with the `-r` flag.

```
pylint -r yes firebase
```
