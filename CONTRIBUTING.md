## <a name="question"></a>Have a usage question?

We get lots of those and we love helping you, but GitHub is not the best place for them. Issues
which just ask about usage will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Go through the [guides](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/)
- Read the full [API reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/python/)

If the official documentation doesn't help, try asking a question on the
[Firebase Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk/) or one of our
other [official support channels](https://firebase.google.com/support/).

**Please avoid double posting across multiple channels!**


## <a name="issue"></a>Think you found a bug?

Yeah, we're definitely not perfect!

Search through [old issues](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python/issues) before
submitting a new issue as your question may have already been answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported,
[open a new issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python/issues/new). Please use the
provided bug report template and include a minimal repro.

If you are up to the challenge, [submit a pull request](#submit) with a fix!

## <a name="local-setup"></a>Need to get set up locally?

### Initial Setup

You need Python 3.7+ to build and test the code in this repo.

We recommend using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) for installing the necessary tools and
project dependencies. Most recent versions of Python ship with pip. If your development environment
does not already have pip, use the software package manager of your platform (e.g. apt-get, brew)
to download and install it. Alternatively you may also follow the official
[pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Once pip is installed, run the following commands from the command line to get your local
environment set up:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python.git
$ cd firebase-admin-python         # go to the firebase-admin-python directory
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install additional tools and dependencies
```

### Running Linters

We use [pylint](https://pylint.org/) for verifying source code format, and
enforcing other Python programming best practices.
There is a pylint configuration file ([`.pylintrc`](.pylintrc)) at the root of this Git
repository. This enables you to invoke pylint directly from the command line:

```
pylint firebase_admin
```

However, it is recommended that you use the [`lint.sh`](lint.sh) bash script to invoke
pylint. This script will run the linter on both `firebase_admin` and the corresponding
`tests` module. It suppresses some of the noisy warnings that get generated
when running pylint on test code. Note that by default `lint.sh` will only
validate the locally modified source files. To validate all source files,
pass `all` as an argument.

```
./lint.sh      # Lint locally modified source files
./lint.sh all  # Lint all source files
```

Ideally you should not see any pylint errors or warnings when you run the
linter. This means source files are properly formatted, and the linter has
not found any issues. If you do observe any errors, fix them before
committing or sending a pull request. Details on how to interpret pylint
errors are available
[here](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/output.html).

Our configuration files suppress the verbose reports usually generated
by pylint, and only output the detected issues. If you wish to obtain the
comprehensive reports, run pylint from command-line with the `-r` flag.

```
pylint -r yes firebase_admin
```

### Unit Testing

We use [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) for writing and executing
unit tests. All source files containing test code is located in the `tests/`
directory. Simply launch pytest from the root of the Git repository, or from
within the `tests/` directory to execute all test cases.

```
pytest
```

Refer to the pytest [usage and invocations guide](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html)
to learn how to run a subset of all test cases.

You can also get a code coverage report by launching pytest as follows:

```
pytest --cov=firebase_admin --cov=tests
```

### Integration Testing


Integration tests are executed against a real life Firebase project. If you do not already
have one suitable for running the tests against, you can create a new project in the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) following the setup guide below.
If you already have a Firebase project, you'll need to obtain credentials to communicate and
authorize access to your Firebase project:


1. Service account certificate: This allows access to your Firebase project through a service account
which is required for all integration tests. This can be downloaded as a JSON file from the 
**Settings > Service Accounts** tab of the Firebase console when you click the
**Generate new private key** button. Copy the file into the repo so it's available at `cert.json`.
   > **Note:** Service accounts should be carefully managed and their keys should never be stored in publicly accessible source code or repositories.


2. Web API key: This allows for Auth sign-in needed for some Authentication and Tenant Management
integration tests. This is displayed in the **Settings > General** tab of the Firebase console
after enabling Authentication as described in the steps below. Copy it and save to a new text
file at `apikey.txt`.


Set up your Firebase project as follows:


1. Enable Authentication:
   1. Go to the Firebase Console, and select **Authentication** from the **Build** menu.
   2. Click on **Get Started**.
   3. Select **Sign-in method > Add new provider > Email/Password** then enable both the
   **Email/Password** and **Email link (passwordless sign-in)** options.


2. Enable Firestore:
   1. Go to the Firebase Console, and select **Firestore Database** from the **Build** menu.
   2. Click on the **Create database** button. You can choose to set up Firestore either in
   the production mode or in the test mode.


3. Enable Realtime Database:
   1. Go to the Firebase Console, and select **Realtime Database** from the **Build** menu.
   2. Click on the **Create Database** button. You can choose to set up the Realtime Database
   either in the locked mode or in the test mode.

   > **Note:** Integration tests are not run against the default Realtime Database reference and are
   instead run against a database created at `https://{PROJECT_ID}.firebaseio.com`.
   This second Realtime Database reference is created in the following steps.

   3. In the **Data** tab click on the kebab menu (3 dots) and select **Create Database**.
   4. Enter your Project ID (Found in the **General** tab in **Account Settings**) as the
   **Realtime Database reference**. Again, you can choose to set up the Realtime Database
   either in the locked mode or in the test mode.


4. Enable Storage:
   1. Go to the Firebase Console, and select **Storage** from the **Build** menu.
   2. Click on the **Get started** button. You can choose to set up Cloud Storage
   either in the production mode or in the test mode.


5. Enable the Firebase ML API:
   1. Go to the
   [Google Cloud console | Firebase ML API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/firebaseml.googleapis.com/overview)
   and make sure your project is selected.
   2. If the API is not already enabled, click **Enable**.


6. Enable the IAM API:
   1. Go to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   and make sure your Firebase project is selected.
   2. Select **APIs & Services** from the main menu, and click the
   **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** button.
   3. Search for and enable **Identity and Access Management (IAM) API** by Google Enterprise API.


7. Enable Tenant Management:
   1. Go to
   [Google Cloud console | Identity Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/customer-identity/)
   and if it is not already enabled, click **Enable**.
   2. Then
   [enable multi-tenancy](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/multi-tenancy-quickstart#enabling_multi-tenancy)
   for your project.


8. Ensure your service account has the **Firebase Authentication Admin** role. This is required
to ensure that exported user records contain the password hashes of the user accounts:
   1. Go to [Google Cloud console | IAM & admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin).
   2. Find your service account in the list. If not added click the pencil icon to edit its
   permissions.
   3. Click **ADD ANOTHER ROLE** and choose **Firebase Authentication Admin**.
   4. Click **SAVE**.


Now you can invoke the integration test suite as follows:

```
pytest integration/ --cert cert.json --apikey apikey.txt
```

### Emulator-based Integration Testing

Some integration tests can run against emulators. This allows local testing
without using real projects or credentials. For now, only the RTDB Emulator
is supported.

First, install the Firebase CLI, then run:

```
firebase emulators:exec --only database --project fake-project-id 'pytest integration/test_db.py'
```

### Test Coverage

To review the test coverage, run `pytest` with the `--cov` flag. To view a detailed line by line
coverage, use
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report html
```
and point your browser to
`file:///<dir>/htmlcov/index.html` (where `dir` is the location from which the report was created).
