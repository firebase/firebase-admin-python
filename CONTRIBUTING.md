## <a name="question"></a>Have a usage question?

We get lots of those and we love helping you, but GitHub is not the best place for them. Issues
which just ask about usage will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Go through the [guides](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/)
- Read the full [API reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/python/)

If the official documentation doesn't help, try asking a question on the
[Firebase Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk/) or one of our
other [official support channels](https://firebase.google.com/support/).

**Please avoid double posting across multiple channels!**


## <a name="issue"></a>Think you found a bug?

Yeah, we're definitely not perfect!

Search through [old issues](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python/issues) before
submitting a new issue as your question may have already been answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported,
[open a new issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python/issues/new). Please use the
provided bug report template and include a minimal repro.

If you are up to the challenge, [submit a pull request](#submit) with a fix!

## <a name="local-setup"></a>Need to get set up locally?

### Initial Setup

You need Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+ to build and test the code in this repo.

We recommend using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) for installing the necessary tools and
project dependencies. Most recent versions of Python ship with pip. If your development environment
does not already have pip, use the software package manager of your platform (e.g. apt-get, brew)
to download and install it. Alternatively you may also follow the official
[pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Once pip is installed, run the following commands from the command line to get your local
environment set up:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python.git
$ cd firebase-admin-python         # go to the firebase-admin-python directory
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install additional tools and dependencies
```

### Running Linters

We use [pylint](https://pylint.org/) for verifying source code format, and
enforcing other Python programming best practices.
There is a pylint configuration file ([`.pylintrc`](.pylintrc)) at the root of this Git
repository. This enables you to invoke pylint directly from the command line:

```
pylint firebase_admin
```

However, it is recommended that you use the [`lint.sh`](lint.sh) bash script to invoke
pylint. This script will run the linter on both `firebase_admin` and the corresponding
`tests` module. It suppresses some of the noisy warnings that get generated
when running pylint on test code. Note that by default `lint.sh` will only
validate the locally modified source files. To validate all source files,
pass `all` as an argument.

```
./lint.sh      # Lint locally modified source files
./lint.sh all  # Lint all source files
```

Ideally you should not see any pylint errors or warnings when you run the
linter. This means source files are properly formatted, and the linter has
not found any issues. If you do observe any errors, fix them before
committing or sending a pull request. Details on how to interpret pylint
errors are available
[here](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/output.html).

Our configuration files suppress the verbose reports usually generated
by pylint, and only output the detected issues. If you wish to obtain the
comprehensive reports, run pylint from command-line with the `-r` flag.

```
pylint -r yes firebase_admin
```

### Unit Testing

We use [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) for writing and executing
unit tests. All source files containing test code is located in the `tests/`
directory. Simply launch pytest from the root of the Git repository, or from
within the `tests/` directory to execute all test cases.

```
pytest
```

Refer to the pytest [usage and invocations guide](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html)
to learn how to run a subset of all test cases.

You can also get a code coverage report by launching pytest as follows:

```
pytest --cov=firebase_admin --cov=tests
```

### Integration Testing

A suite of integration tests are available under the `integration/` directory.
These tests are designed to run against an actual Firebase project. Create a new
project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), if you
do not already have one suitable for running the tests aginst. Then obtain the
following credentials from the project:

1. *Service account certificate*: This can be downloaded as a JSON file from
   the "Settings > Service Accounts" tab of the Firebase console. Copy the
   file into the repo so it's available at `scripts/cert.json`.
2. *Web API key*: This is displayed in the "Settings > General" tab of the
   console. Copy it and save to a new text file at `scripts/apikey.txt`.

Then set up your Firebase/GCP project as follows:

1. Enable Firestore: Go to the Firebase Console, and select "Database" from
   the "Develop" menu. Click on the "Create database" button. You may choose
   to set up Firestore either in the locked mode or in the test mode.
2. Enable password auth: Select "Authentication" from the "Develop" menu in
   Firebase Console. Select the "Sign-in method" tab, and enable the
   "Email/Password" sign-in method, including the Email link (passwordless
   sign-in) option.

3. Enable the IAM API: Go to the
   [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and make
   sure your Firebase/GCP project is selected. Select "APIs & Services >
   Dashboard" from the main menu, and click the "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"
   button. Search for and enable the "Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   API".
4. Grant your service account the 'Firebase Authentication Admin' role. This is
   required to ensure that exported user records contain the password hashes of
   the user accounts:
   1. Go to [Google Cloud Platform Console / IAM & admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin).
   2. Find your service account in the list, and click the 'pencil' icon to edit it's permissions.
   3. Click 'ADD ANOTHER ROLE' and choose 'Firebase Authentication Admin'.
   4. Click 'SAVE'.


Now you can invoke the integration test suite as follows:

```
pytest integration/ --cert scripts/cert.json --apikey scripts/apikey.txt
```

### Emulator-based Integration Testing

Some integration tests can run against emulators. This allows local testing
without using real projects or credentials. For now, only the RTDB Emulator
is supported.

First, install the Firebase CLI, then run:

```
firebase emulators:exec --only database --project fake-project-id 'pytest integration/test_db.py'
```

### Test Coverage

To review the test coverage, run `pytest` with the `--cov` flag. To view a detailed line by line
coverage, use
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report html
```
and point your browser to
`file:///<dir>/htmlcov/index.html` (where `dir` is the location from which the report was created).


### Testing in Different Environments

Sometimes we want to run unit tests in multiple environments (e.g. different Python versions), and
ensure that the SDK works as expected in each of them. We use
[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for this purpose.

But before you can invoke tox, you must set up all the necessary target environments on your
workstation. The easiest and cleanest way to achieve this is by using a tool like
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). Refer to the
[pyenv documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) for instructions on how to
install it. This generally involves installing some binaries as well as modifying a system level
configuration file such as `.bash_profile`. Once pyenv is installed, you can install multiple
versions of Python as follows:

```
pyenv install 2.7.6        # install Python 2.7.6
pyenv install 3.3.0        # install Python 3.3.0
pyenv install pypy2-5.6.0  # install pypy2
```

Refer to the [`tox.ini`](tox.ini) file for a list of target environments that we usually test.
Use pyenv to install all the required Python versions on your workstation. Verify that they are
installed by running the following command:

```
pyenv versions
```

To make all the required Python versions available to tox for testing, run the `pyenv local` command
with all the Python versions as arguments. The following example shows how to make Python versions
2.7.6, 3.3.0 and pypy2 available to tox.

```
pyenv local 2.7.6 3.3.0 pypy2-5.6.0
```

Once your system is fully set up, you can execute the following command from the root of the
repository to launch tox:

```
tox
```

This command will read the list of target environments from `tox.ini`, and execute tests in each of
those environments. It will also generate a code coverage report at the end of the execution.

### Repo Organization
